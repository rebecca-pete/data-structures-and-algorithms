# Challenge Summary
Array Shift without Know Methods

## Challenge Description
Write a function that takes in an array and a number. Insert the number into the center of the array. In the case of an array with an odd number of elements, insert directly after the center element.

## Approach & Efficiency
Jag, Morgana, Jess, Melissa, and I worked together on this whiteboard problem. We opted to modify the array in place. We also opted to work back from the end of the array, rather than the start.
