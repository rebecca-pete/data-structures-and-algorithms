# Hashtables
Implement a Hashtable with the following methods: add, get, contains, and hash.

## Challenge
Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency
Storing data as key, value pairs in objects within an array allows for O(1) search capabilities.

## API
