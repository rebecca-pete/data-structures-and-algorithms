# Stacks and Queues
The stacks-and-queues.js file includes definitions for the Stack and Queue classes along with methods for each.

## Challenge
Write class definitions for Node, Stack and Queue. Include methods for Stack and Queue. Include proper testing.

## Approach & Efficiency
The space and time efficieny for the Queue and Stack methods are O(1),  although it could be argued that the Queue enqueue method is O(n) because of the use of arrays and shift. 

## API
The Stack class includes the push, peek, and pop methods. The Queue class includes the enqueue, peek, and dequeue methods.
