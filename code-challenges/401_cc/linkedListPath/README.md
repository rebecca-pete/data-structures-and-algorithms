# Challenge Summary
Code Challenge 31

## Challenge Description
Problem Domain: Given a Binary tree and two values (A and B). Return a linked list representing the Path from A to B. Assume that both values exist in the tree. Assume that the tree includes at least two nodes. The tree is not sorted. The tree values are integers. Assume value A is the value closest to the root.

## Approach & Efficiency
Approach: Divide and Conquer
Write a function to find the first value in the tree.
Write a function to find the second value in the tree.
Create a linked list documenting the path from A to B.
Search tree using pre-order method. Use recursion.
